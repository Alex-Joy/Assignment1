  <p> I was not surprised with the results that I have got for these tests. I read through all the results in more detail and realised that it was a digital copy of my personality but in the form of data. I love how a number of questions reveals so much of how people think like. I have seen through this tests that I am a calm person, who is always on his feet doing things. The tests refer to me as an interesting person. I see these tests as a general perception of a personality. I don’t see this data as fact. The mind is a very complicated and heavily wired piece of organic machinery, it is very hard to just pin point exactly how someone behaves and thinks. </p>
  <p> The test results show that I am productive within a team, and this is correct. I love working with others, as everyone has diverse and interesting ideas that give me a different point of view on the whole situation. The tests explain how I might put myself as leader and manage things for people within the team. I agree to an extent with this result, as I do sometimes tend to assume responsibility over whole projects and see that it is done to a particular standard. In some ways it is beneficial, but in most cases I do wish to listen to other people’s inputs and ideas. </p>
  <p>When forming a team for future assignments I will try to listen more instead of preach. It will allow me to understand the assignment questions and requirements in a different and more diverse way, making the whole experience even more engaging. I usually do fit into teams and groups fairly well and try my best to support the group until the end. </p>
