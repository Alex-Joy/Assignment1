  <h3 style="text-align: center">INTEREST IN I.T</h3>
<br>
<br> 
  <p>I first gained interest in technology when I was in 8th grade and saw and started watching some good movies. I loved watching sci-fi movies and shows like Star Trek, Star Wars, The Matrix, 2001 space odyssey. What I loved was the implementation of different technological ideas like, warp speed, star ships, long distance communicators, cryogenics and that one motion tracker from the Alien movies. I am defiantly a dreamer and want to see and experience all that tech has to offer.  </p>
  <p>At first, I couldn’t be bothered to learn different programming languages, as I saw it as confusing and very hard. It took some time for me to become comfortable to even see lines of code. It was grade 11 that changed my whole outlook on tech. Mr Coggins my VCE computing teacher was defiantly on my list of best teachers. He explained concepts and ideas in a more meaningful way, and encouraged us to ask questions and developed a teaching style that suited each student. After that year instead of asking myself ‘how did they do that?’ it turned to ‘how can I do that?’.</p>
  <p>I didn’t have much interest on which University I should join but, my sisters experience with the way things are run at RMIT convinced me this was a great place to start. I understood before applying that RMIT was a prestigious University that had ties with companies and organisation, which can benefit me and my peers in the long run. As well as the excellent and highly trained and professional staff.</p>
  <p> I am expecting to learn many things, I walked into this course knowing the amount of work programming and information technology is. I actually mis not having gone through the first two and a half weeks with peers and people who share the same interests. But even with the short time I have spent in this course, I am even more exited for the new ideas and concepts that I am about to learn in programming and info tech. </p>
