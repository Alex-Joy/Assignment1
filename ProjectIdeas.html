  <br>
  <p>In high school I had completed a prototype tracked mechanical robot, that had a face tracking subsystem. The idea was it was going to be for search and rescue operations, reaching places were humans cannot. I would like to continue to refine the machine and its sub systems. The prototype worked as it was meant to, but I would love to give it more features so that it can be even more useful in tougher and dangerous situations. I have already laid the ground work for the basic systems that the robot should include, including wireless control and basic face tracking characteristics. Improving and adding to the systems of this robot will ensure it does a better job in the field. </p>
  <p> As technology evolves it is easier and easier to fit more powerful computers and sub systems within a smaller space. With current technology it is quite easy to achieve. Wit the fall in price for computer parts especially Arduino and Raspberry Pi, it has made it easier for an average person to make wonderful and intricate works of engineering and technological art. As more and more people learn how to efficiently use these computer parts and systems, they learn how to innovate and adapt certain traditional methods to work in a unique and new way. With natural disasters and dangerous events at an all time high, it is not ideal to send a living human into dangerous places and look for people or animals who need help. With a robot that is controlled by a well-trained human it would be no hassle at all.  </p>
  <p> Right now, as it stands the version 1 of my long-term project has wireless control features using Arduino and a dedicated motor driving module. These two systems work together to spin the tracks and tell the robot where to go with the input through a user interface on your phone. The second subsystem is the face tracker. This subsystem is powered using Raspberry Pi with OpenCV software downloaded on it. Processing takes the video input from the webcam and uses the OpenCV library to analyse the video. If a face is detected in the video, the OpenCV library will give the Processing sketch the coordinates of the face. The processing sketch will determine where the face is located in the frame, relative to the centre of the frame, and send this data through a serial connection to an Arduino. The data is sent through the Arduino to two servos that control the motion of the camera. I would like to upgrade some of the components within the subsystems to achieve a better overall result. This involves a more powerful antenna and receiver that can help with increased range and uninterrupted close-range communications with the robot. Another improvement would be the implementation of a thermal and night vision camera instead of the 1080p standard camera in use now. This will allow for better search and rescue results, as it would work both at night and highly condensed environments. Another addition could be an independent face tracking system, as I have seen many issues rise with the OpenCV model over longer periods of use as well as distance. I would also try changing up the structural elements such as the actually body of the robot, making it bigger to house all the critical systems and sub-system computers and sensors. This can be done through use of CAD software and the use of laser cutter. Lastly an additional sub-system that uses ultrasonic sensors paired with a lidar scanner for autonomous driving. This would take some of the human elements away and enable the computers to decide an appropriate way through tough terrain. This would also allow the person controlling to take brakes if the operations a longer. With the help of all the sub-systems like the face and motion tracking, as well as other sensors the new and improved version would succeed more in its overall purpose. </p>
  <p> The tools and technology that will be used will include a mix of hardware and software components. Hardware being cameras, sensors, lights and modules. The software is as important or even more important to reach the end goal, as without it the whole system would not function together. The software in use would include Auto CAD for designing and implementing a new structure/body. Panasonics new open-sourced auto tracking software for cameras, to help with detecting life and motion out in the field. A mini cube computer, which is 10x more powerful than a raspberry pi for all the software to run off for all the sub-systems, this would drastically change the accuracy and functionality of the robot. </p>
  <p> The skills required for this project are not too hard to learn. It will certainly not be easy to get all the work done but it will take time for all the systems and sub-systems to be learnt. The software that is involved would include Arduino, which I have basic to intermediate knowledge of coding. I have been using Auto CAD for more than 2 years now and know how to use the software effectively. The other software such as the code run on the open-sourced auto-tracking would be the only real issue. As I would need to experiment and learn more on how to use the program efficiently and effectively.</p>
  <p> If all the sub-systems and components all work together in harmony to create a working machine, then the purpose would defiantly be fulfilled. The robot will be made to be used in tough conditions where humans cannot venture. If this robot does work as intended, and does get deployed out into the field it will defiantly save lives and prevent deaths. Having the security of a system that can find people in hostile environments and terrain will be essential as situations like natural disasters and other life-threatening events are at an all time high, and will keep increasing. </p>
